//JOSH BARTON
//Created the SportsCourt class

I collaborated with Andrew Delis on this assignment. I created
a Sports Court room that allows you to pick up a ball and shoot it. In order
to make a shot, however, you need to have socks on which you can get from
Andrews laundry room. Once you have the socks on you will be able to make
a shot. Andrew uses my ball to help fix his washing machine in the Laundry
Room. If you throw the ball at the laundry room, it will get fixed.
